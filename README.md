# PurchaseSummary
React Native purchase summary app. 
Key elements:
-Pickup savings - uses a Modal to display a pickup message. Had to use a Close button, but ideally you should close the
Modal by clicking outside of it.
-See item details - expands to show an item image and text. 
-Apply Promo Code - expands to show a promo code field.

Known issues:
1. The Pickup savings modal has a Close button. It should be closed by clicking outside of it.
2. See item details only shows the image, and it's too short. It should display an item's image and description, and the 
box should be big enough to see all of it.
3. Apply promo code only shows a little of the text; it's too short. It should display the whole promo code message, and
it should be an input field.
4. The pickup Modal shows automatically on startup. It should only display when the Pickup savings is clicked.
5. The UI needs a lot of improvement in layout and appearance.
6. Did not implement the 10% discount.
